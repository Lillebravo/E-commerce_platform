Building a e-commerce platform for my friend

## 1. Frontend Development
* HTML/CSS: Use HTML to structure your web pages and CSS to style them.
* JavaScript Frameworks: Use frameworks like React, Vue.js, or Angular to create dynamic user interfaces. These frameworks allow you to build components that can manage product listings, user authentication, and shopping carts.
---
## 2. Backend Development
* Node.js: Use Node.js to create a server that handles requests, manages sessions, and interacts with a database. Express.js is a popular framework for building web applications with Node.js.
* Database: Use a database like MongoDB (NoSQL) or PostgreSQL/MySQL (SQL) to store product data, user information, and order history. You can interact with the database using JavaScript through libraries like Mongoose (for MongoDB) or Sequelize (for SQL databases).
---
## 3. Payment Processing
* Integrate payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal. These services provide JavaScript SDKs that you can use to handle payment processing securely on your site.
---
## 4. Hosting and Deployment
* Use platforms like Vercel, Heroku, or DigitalOcean to host your application. These platforms support Node.js applications and can help you deploy your store easily.
---
## 5. Example Stack
* Frontend: React.js for building the user interface.
* Backend: Node.js with Express.js for the server.
* Database: MongoDB for storing data.
* Payment: Stripe API for handling payments.
